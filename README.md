- Low Number of Black and Latino Students in specialized High Schools.
- Only 10% of New York City's public school students are black/latino received offers, even though 67% of public students are black/latino
- Asians make up 62% of students at specialized high schools, even though 16% of public students are asian
- Whites make up 24% of students at specialized highs schools, even though 15% of public students are white

### Hypothesis: Before we begin doing any analysis, it's always best to have some ideas in mind to understand why underrepresented groups of students are not receiving the help they need. Here are a few ideas to explre the data

- Community VS Non-Community schools should have an impact to the type of students
- Race can be a proxy for a student's need of help, this is very debatable
- A school's location can be a proxy for students in need of help
- Student overall performance per school can be a proxy as well
